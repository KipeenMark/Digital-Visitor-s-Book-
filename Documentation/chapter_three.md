CHAPTER THREE
METHODOLOGY

3.1 Introduction
This chapter outlines the methodology employed in the Digital Visitors Book project to address the challenges identified in Chapter One and achieve the outlined objectives. The methodology section provides a detailed explanation of the approaches and techniques used in developing and implementing the digital visitor management system. The chapter begins by discussing the overall development methodology, focusing on the Agile approach chosen for this project. It then describes the specific techniques for system analysis and design, including the tools and methods used for gathering requirements and designing the solution. Additionally, the chapter covers data collection methods and ethical considerations relevant to the project's implementation.

3.2 Research Methodology

3.2.1 Development Methodology
The Digital Visitors Book project adopts an Agile development methodology, specifically using the Scrum framework. This choice is justified by the following factors:

Development Approach:
- Iterative Development: Enables frequent releases and continuous feedback
- Sprint-based Delivery: Two-week sprints for manageable development cycles
- Daily Stand-ups: Regular team communication and issue resolution
- Sprint Reviews: Demonstration of completed features to stakeholders
- Sprint Retrospectives: Continuous process improvement

Justification for Agile Selection:
1. Project Requirements
   - Evolving user requirements need flexible adaptation
   - Regular stakeholder feedback is essential
   - Incremental delivery provides early value

2. Project Size
   - Medium-scale project suitable for Agile management
   - Small development team enables effective communication
   - Modular features allow incremental development

3. Expected Outcomes
   - Early and continuous delivery of working software
   - Regular stakeholder involvement ensures alignment
   - Rapid response to requirement changes

Iterative Processes:
Phase 1: Initial Setup (Sprint 1-2)
- Project environment setup
- Basic architecture implementation
- Core database design

Phase 2: Core Features (Sprint 3-4)
- Visitor registration module
- Check-in/check-out functionality
- Basic reporting features

Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Sprint 5-6)
- Appointment scheduling
- QR code integration
- Advanced analytics

Phase 4: Security and Integration (Sprint 7-8)
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption
- API implementation

3.3 Data Collection Methods
