1.7Proposed System
The proposed system will consist of a web-based application that allows organizations to manage visitor check-ins and check-outs efficiently. Features will include visitor registration, appointment scheduling, and data analytics.

1.8System Modules
i.Visitor Registration Module: This module allows visitors to register their details upon arrival, capturing essential information such as name, contact details, and purpose of visit. This data is stored securely for future reference.

ii.Appointment Scheduling Module: This feature enables visitors to pre-book appointments or meetings online, ensuring that hosts are prepared for their arrival and reducing wait times.

iii.Check-in/Check-out Module: This module facilitates the check-in and check-out process, allowing visitors to log their arrival and departure times easily. It can also generate visitor badges for identification.

iv.Data Analytics Module: This module provides insights into visitor patterns, such as peak visiting hours and repeat visitors. It helps organizations make informed decisions based on visitor data.

v.Photo Capture & ID Upload Module: This module allows visitors to take a photo or upload an ID for security purposes, enhancing the verification process.

vi.QR Code Check-In Module: This feature generates QR codes for regular visitors, enabling fast check-in by scanning the code, which auto-fills their details.

vii.Feedback Section Module: After checking out, this module prompts visitors to leave feedback or a prayer request, allowing organizations to gather insights on visitor experiences.

viii.Role-Based Access Module: This module ensures that only authorized users can export data, manage entries, or access full reports, enhancing data security.

1.9Significance of the Study
