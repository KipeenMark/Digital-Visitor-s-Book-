CHAPTER TWO
LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1 Introduction
In this chapter, a comprehensive review of the existing literature and relevant research is presented to establish the foundation for the Digital Visitors Book project. A literature review is a "critical analysis of a segment of published body of knowledge through summary, classification, and comparison of prior research studies, reviews of literature, and theoretical articles" (Webster & Watson, 2022). This chapter begins by exploring the theoretical frameworks and methodologies that underpin visitor management systems, particularly in relation to the challenges identified in Chapter One. It examines key concepts, trends, and advancements within digital visitor management that inform the development of the proposed solution.

Furthermore, this chapter analyzes previous implementations of visitor management systems, highlighting their methodologies, features, and limitations. By critically evaluating these systems, the chapter identifies gaps in existing solutions that the current project seeks to address. Additionally, it discusses the relevance of various technologies, tools, and approaches applicable to creating an efficient digital visitor management system. Overall, Chapter Two provides a contextual backdrop for the project, demonstrating its significance within the broader landscape of digital transformation in organizational security and visitor management.
